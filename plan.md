# AMO Events Platform Knowledge Base Implementation Plan

## Project Checklist

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 1: Project Setup and Environment Configuration
- [x] Create and navigate to project directory
- [ ] Set up version control (init git repository)
- [ ] Create virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
- [ ] Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
- [ ] Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- [ ] Set up API keys in .env file:
  - [ ] Add OpenAI API key
  - [ ] Add Pinecone API key
  - [ ] Specify Pinecone index name
  
### ðŸ“‹ Phase 2: Testing Basic Functionality
- [ ] Test scripts/query.py with a sample question
- [ ] Debug and fix any issues with the query script
- [ ] Test scripts/chat.py for interactive functionality
- [ ] Debug and fix any issues with the chat script
- [ ] Launch Streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`
- [ ] Verify web interface functionality
- [ ] Test each integrated component (OpenAI, Pinecone, LangChain)

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 3: Knowledge Base Population (if needed)
- [ ] Collect documentation about:
  - [ ] Webflow development for events
  - [ ] Airtable database structures for events
  - [ ] Xano backend implementation
  - [ ] n8n workflow automation
  - [ ] WhatsApp API integration
- [ ] Process documents into embeddings
- [ ] Upload embeddings to Pinecone index
- [ ] Verify document retrieval accuracy

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 4: Prompt Engineering and Optimization
- [ ] Review and refine system prompts in utils/prompts.py
- [ ] Adjust retrieval parameters for optimal results
- [ ] Test with a variety of question formats
- [ ] Optimize response quality and accuracy
- [ ] Add more domain-specific context if needed

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 5: User Interface Improvements
- [ ] Expand common questions in app.py
- [ ] Improve visual design of the Streamlit interface
- [ ] Add loading indicators for better UX
- [ ] Implement error handling improvements
- [ ] Add user feedback collection mechanism

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 6: Deployment and Documentation
- [ ] Complete project documentation
- [ ] Create user guide for team members
- [ ] Prepare for production deployment
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Plan for ongoing maintenance and updates

## Notes and Progress Tracking

*Add your notes, observations, and completion status here as you progress through the project*

Date: January, 2024
Progress: Project structure created with all necessary files. Initial code for query, chat, and web interface implemented. API key placeholders added to .env file.
Next Steps: Initialize git repository, create virtual environment, and install dependencies. Test basic functionality with sample queries.

## Important Updates

- **January 2024**: Pinecone no longer requires a separate environment parameter in newer versions. The .env file has been updated accordingly.
- **Code Structure**: All necessary files have been created including prompts.py, query.py, chat.py, and app.py.
- **Requirements**: Dependencies have been specified in requirements.txt with exact versions.
